# Data-Science
This is my preparation journey for data science
<details>
<summary>1. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)</summary>
<br>tip: if you get errors while running code of notebooks --> try run all option at the top!ðŸ˜‰
<br> q1, q2 such objects are created by Kaggle, so Don't worry about it.
<br> similarly, check, hint, solution are functions created by Kaggle, don't get confused for python syntax.

1. Roadblock: if any errors, first try run all option.
Still in intro to machine learning course, I'm getting error on this page
